This solo project was given to us to cement the concept of component creation with the user in mind. It really helped grasp the usecase for libraries and the options that can be made available to our users to effectively utilize these components while maintaining boundaries that protect the integrity of our components. 

Here I am displaying four components on screen that render information according to the props and classnames set by the user.
